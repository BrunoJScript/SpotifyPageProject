🔧 Setup and Installation

    Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-project-page.git
cd spotify-project-page

    Install dependencies

npm install

    Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root and add your Spotify credentials:

REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback

    Start the development server

npm start

🧠 How It Works

    User logs in using Spotify OAuth

    Access token is stored and used to make requests to the Spotify Web API

    App fetches and displays user data (playlists, tracks, albums)

    Music control actions (play, pause, skip) are sent via the API

    Dynamic UI updates based on playback and user interaction

🧪 Testing

Use Jest or React Testing Library for component testing.
